# minact-harness
This is a test environment for the Minact library, built to support a presentation on how Minact was built.

## Installation
Simply clone the repo, run `npm install` and `npm start`.

Once it is up and running, you can copy code from `/dist/js/framework/minact-versions` to `/dist/js/framework/minact.js` to see it working in various states.  You can also update the JavaScript in `/src/harness` to try out different samples.
